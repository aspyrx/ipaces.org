Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,\nthe meeting will be fully virtual only.</p>\n<p><a href="announcement.pdf">See attachment for the meeting schedule.</a></p>\n<p>The first day’s meeting focuses on geophysics and seismology jointly with\nChengdu University of Technology (CDUT), the second day focuses on environmental\ngeography and hydrogeology, jointly with Tianjing Normal University (TJNU), and\nthe last day is the writing workshop. Since we cannot keep the virtual meeting\nfor too long (due to the time difference between US and China), we decide to\nfocus on certain topics, and the talks are invite-only this time. On June 21st\nand June 22nd morning from 8-9 am, we arrange a special one-hour meeting time\nbetween IPACES and CDUT and TJNU to discuss topics such as recruitment of\nyoung-generation scientists and collaborations during COVID and changing\nenvironments. We welcome our IPACES members to join the virtual meeting and\nparticipate in the discussions remotely.</p>\n<h3 id="ipaces-2021-执行委员会成员">IPACES 2021 执行委员会成员</h3>\n<p>张铭（主席）、叶明（上任主席）、彭志刚（副主席）、腾辉（财务长）</p>\n'}})}}}]);
