# 地球科学前沿网络研讨会
## Frontiers in Earth Science Virtual Meeting
### 中国地球科学促进会（IPACES）2021 年会

We have been in the process of preparing the IPACES annual meeting this year
(June 21st to 23rd morning Beijing time). Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,
the meeting will be fully virtual only.

[See attachment for the meeting schedule.](announcement.pdf)

The first day’s meeting focuses on geophysics and seismology jointly with
Chengdu University of Technology (CDUT), the second day focuses on environmental
geography and hydrogeology, jointly with Tianjing Normal University (TJNU), and
the last day is the writing workshop. Since we cannot keep the virtual meeting
for too long (due to the time difference between US and China), we decide to
focus on certain topics, and the talks are invite-only this time. On June 21st
and June 22nd morning from 8-9 am, we arrange a special one-hour meeting time
between IPACES and CDUT and TJNU to discuss topics such as recruitment of
young-generation scientists and collaborations during COVID and changing
environments. We welcome our IPACES members to join the virtual meeting and
participate in the discussions remotely.
