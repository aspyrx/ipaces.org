The IPACES logo was redesigned in 2019 by IPACES member Dr. Jianli Chen at the
University of Texas at Austin. The centered artwork is a cartoon graphic of
Pangaea (or Pangea), a supercontinent that existed during the late Paleozoic and
early Mesozoic eras. With all continents joined together, united, and connected,
Pangaea is a perfect match with the IPACES mission to promote cooperations in
Earth Sciences between China and other countries.
