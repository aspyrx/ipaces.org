The IPACES insignia was designed in 1999 with Mark Klinger of the Carnegie
Museum, in consultation with Youxue Zhang while he was a curator at the Museum.
The centered artwork is *张衡地动仪* (*Zhang Heng seismograph*), by stipple
drawing, based on a photo of a 1980s model/replica produced by 中国地震局
(China Earthquake Administration).
