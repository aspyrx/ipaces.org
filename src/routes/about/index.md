The term “Chinese Earth Scientists” refers to Earth Scientists with ethnic

The IPACES logo was redesigned in 2023 by IPACES member Dr. Jianli Chen at the
Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The centered artwork is a cartoon graphic of
Pangaea (or Pangea), a supercontinent that existed during the late Paleozoic and
early Mesozoic eras. With all continents joined together, united, and connected,
Pangaea is a perfect match with the IPACES mission to promote international
collaboration of research and education in the field of Earth Sciences.
